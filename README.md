# Installation

- Clone Project to local machine.

- Open Android Studio and select 'Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)'.
Browse through your file system to the folder 'android' where the project is located.
Android Studio will then create the '.iml' files it needs.
If you ever close the project but the files are still there, you just select 'Open Project...'.
The file chooser will show an Android face as the folder icon, which you can
select to reopen the project.

- Android Studio will try to build the project directly after importing it.
To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just
click the 'Play' button in the tool bar to build and run it in a mobile device
or an emulator. The resulting APK file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/'
subdirectory in the project folder.
